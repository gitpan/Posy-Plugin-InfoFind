  * (19 Jul 2005) improvements to quick-search index
  	Sorting has been improved, and the query-links have been improved,
  taking into account the info_type_spec defined by Posy::Plugin::Info.

0.04 Tue 19 July 2005
---------------------

  * (19 Jul 2005) quick-search indexes
  	Added a quick-search index facility with the infofind_make_index

---------------------

  * (17 Jul 2005) added infofind_sort_criteria
